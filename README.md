# SmartCharging

With the dynamic development of electric vehicles, new challenges arise regarding the surrounding support systems such as the creation and division of charging stations, or real-time organisation of charging schedules. While the charging of a fuel-based vehicle takes only a few minutes, charging an EV is much longer and brings new questions about optimal scheduling of charging jobs.

This code shows how quantum algorithms can be used in order to tackle the difficult problems related to this field. Two different types of scheduling are respectively mapped to UD-MIS and Max-k-cut problems on graphs. We then make use of a quantum algorithm in order to find approximate solutions to these NP-hard problems.
